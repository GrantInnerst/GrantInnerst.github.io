<h1> Bio </h1>

<p class="lead">
  
  I currently hold the position of Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.ship.edu/math/">Mathematics Department</a> at <a href="https://www.ship.edu">Shippensburg University</a>. I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. in the  <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/statistics/">Department of Statistical Science</a> from <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/">Baylor University</a> under the direction of <a href = "https://www.baylor.edu/statistics/index.php?id=941858">David Kahle</a>.
  <br />
  <br />
  Before Baylor, I completed my undergraduate work at Shippensburg University, where I earned a B.S. in Mathematics where I worked with <a href="https://www.clarkson.edu/people/benjamin-galluzzo">Ben Galluzzo</a>. Through Ben's mentorship and two wonderful workshops at <a href="https://www.samsi.info/">SAMSI</a>, I realized my interest in statistics, which started me down this crazy path.
  <br />
  <br />
  In my free time, I love to spend time with my beautiful wife Melissa, who is also a statistician, and our two dogs Einstein and Newton. We love to travel, geocache, and go bowling.
