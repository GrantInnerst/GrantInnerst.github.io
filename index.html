I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at <a href = "http://www.ship.edu/math/">Shippensburg University</a>. I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. in Statistical Science from Baylor University under the direction of <a href = "https://www.baylor.edu/statistics/index.php?id=941858">David Kahle</a>. My research generally lies in the field of algebraic statistics. I am especially interested implementing algebraic statistical methods in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
